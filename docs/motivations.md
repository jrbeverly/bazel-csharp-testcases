# Bazel Examples

When I have been doing development and testing some scenarios with the toolchain, I often want to verify a bunch of test scenarios. Some of these fit with the rules (and could be included as tests), while others do not.

I wanted to have a repository where I could experiment with both API usage ideas, as well as examples I could use while developing.

I have enforced a standard onto the programs in this repository just to ensure that I don't create a graveyard of failing/broken examples.

Additionally I think it would be nice to have a repostory _using_ the csharp rules for bazel that adapts to the evolution of the rules.
